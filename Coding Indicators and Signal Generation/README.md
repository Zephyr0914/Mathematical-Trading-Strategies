The objective of this is to analyze the NASDAQ and NSE indices to identify their correlation and establish potential lead-lag relationships. The next step is to code Keltner Channel, Bollinger Bands, and MACD indicators, determining the optimal parameters for these indicators on one of the indices, and generating buy and sell signals on the other index. 

Tasks:

Correlation Analysis:
a) Collect historical data for NASDAQ and NSE indices.
b) Calculate the correlation coefficient between the two indices.
c) Analyze the strength and direction of the relationship.

Lead-Lag Relationship:
a) Identify potential lead-lag relationships between the indices.
b) Analyze data to determine consistent leading or lagging behaviour.
c) Use the lead-lag relationship to determine the index to be used for parameter optimization.
d) Provide an explanation for choosing the index for parameter optimization

Indicator Coding:
a) Code Keltner Channel, Bollinger Bands, and MACD indicators.

Signal Generation:
a) Apply optimized parameters to the other index.
b) Generate buy and sell signals using the indicators.
c) Record the signals, their respective dates and returns along with other metrics covered before.
